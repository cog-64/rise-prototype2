# RISE - Real-time Information for Social Empowerment
=======================================================
## rise-prototype2 - Fully functioning prototype of the RISE tool.

*RISE* is a real-time tactical messaging tool, intended to be used by
adhoc, anonymous groups of users in fast-moving situations of social unrest.  

It is reactive, visual and location aware.  RISE integrates ideas derived from social 
psychology research to empower a random crowd to make informed, co-ordinated decisions, 
while reducing the pitfalls of emotionality, herd behaviours and cascades of incorrect information.

###Features: 
  - Ephemeral, Secure and Anonymous data
  - Location aware
  - Simple to join
  - Based on crowd dynamics psychology
  - Analysis of aggregated results only
  - Mobile friendly
  - Cross-platform
  
###Crowd Features:
  - Diversity of opinions:
    - Everyone has an equal ability to suggest ideas, vote on proposals and report local facts and situations in their envionment.
  - Independence of opinions:
    - objective facts are disseminated to the whole group, while personal interpretation of local situations are kept private but aggregated for decsion making purposes.
  - Decentralized:
    - local knowledge and experiences of all individuals is used equally as the raw input for automatically calculated decision-making aggregations
  - Timely decisions:
    - aggregated decisions are reflected back to the entire crowd at key inflection points (majority consensus reached, rapid changes in mood, crowd size, etc.)
  - Concise:
    - simple and consistent input and output of messages and facts.
  - Removal of emotionality:
    - anonymous, loose interconnections between actors to reduce peer pressure and herd behaviour
  - Activity co-ordination:
    - based on crowd majority consensus rather than on the imitation of a few original decision makers
