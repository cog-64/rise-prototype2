simulations for testing and demo
================================

- these can't be in a modal, because that would interfere with the ui experience, nor
can they be on a route that will be navigable to and stop when closed

- implement as a bottom sidebar viewable from the functional screens of the app (map especially)

- array of checkbox like objects that turns them on or off

- not to go to production, but bundeled in for the prototype

- a shared simulation object in lib that centralizes running the simulations and allows them to be called from command line


todo
====

- create this as a separate app, one day
